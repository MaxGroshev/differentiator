# Do you want the same way?
```
> git clone https://github.com/MaxGroshev/differentiator.git
> mkdir obj
```

#### Required programs
- LaTeX-full (if want get result in LaTeX format)
- graphviz

# How to use
```
> cd test_files
> nano (or any other text editor) read_descent.txt
> input your func (without any extra symbols)
> cd ..
> make
> ./differ
> make latex_t (to get your result in beatiful LaTeX format)
```
# What it can?
- to differentiate functions such as:
